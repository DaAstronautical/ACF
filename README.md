# Armored Combat Remake

The Armoured Combat Remake is a [Garry's Mod][] addon forked by the people who where tired of being stereotyped as "60 tonne minmaxers" whose goal is to create a realistic and fun armored combat experience that utilises a unique damage system that simulates projectiles, armor, explosions, and mobility components.

Feel free to submit all bugs, exploits, and suggestions on the [Issues][] page. We're always open to new ideas and would be happy to hear suggestions for the addon.

The [ACR Wiki][] is new and pretty empty, we would appreciate any help that we could get.
